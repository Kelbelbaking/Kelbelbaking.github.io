		<h3>Reindeer Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>These were easy Reindeer cupcakes that I made during the holidays to donate to Family House, a place that serves as a home away from home for families of children with cancer in San Francisco. The reindeer themselves were made with Nilla wafers, broken pretzels, tootsie rolls, M&Ms, and edible eyes.  A few of them are "special" and have red noses!</p>

		<h3>Duck Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>Duck cupcakes made for another Easter holiday. I used vanilla cupcakes which I lightly frosted and then for a full duck stuck a donut hole and diagonally cut marshmallow, or for a duck but just a marshmallow. The ducks were then dunked into slightly melted frosting and allowed to harden. M&M eyes, and starburst beaks and feet were then attached.</p>

		<h3>Baseball Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>My entire family loves baseball! So I decided it was finally time I make some baseball cupcakes in varying sizes. The cupcakes were simply frosted with vanilla frosting and then piped with red stitches to look like a baseball.</p>

		<h3>Sunflower Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>Decorated sunflower vanilla cupcakes. Cupcakes were frosted with a light layer of green frosting and then a double stuffed Oreo was placed on top. I then piped yellow frosting on as the sunflower petals. Green Laffy Taffy was molded to be the leaves on the cupcakes. Finally on a few cupcakes a red M&M was placed and decorated with black frosting to look like a ladybug.</p>

		<h3>Salted Caramel Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>I had a Master Chef watching party with my friends the other day, and of course we all needed to bake something ourselves so we could eat while we were watching! Others made Creme Brulee, Chocolate Marquise, and Apple Pie along with my cupcakes. I had a great time hanging out with my friends and baking up a storm. Happy Baking until next time!</p>

		<h3>Owl Cupcakes</h3>
		<p>Saw this idea while I was looking for inspiration online and I just had to make these cute creatures. The perfect occasion presented itself when I decided to bake something for my friends belated birthday. The cupcakes were a hoot and I had fun surprising my friend when I got to cross country practice. Happy baking!</p>
