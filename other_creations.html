		<h3>Fruit Tart</h3>
		<p>For this tart, I focused on creating a healthy, yet delicious dessert. It was the first time I had made this recipe so I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out, but it turned out great. I made a typical crust filled with pastry cream, topped with fresh strawberries and blackberries. <a href="http://www.joyofbaking.com/FruitTart.html" target="_blank">Here</a> was the recipe I used. Until next time!! </p>

                <h3> Panda Sugar Cookies </h3>
                <p> I just used a basic sugar cookie recipe and dyed the dough three different colors. In order to create the pandas I layered the divided dough up into logs and layered them strategically and then rolled the entire log together in plastic wrap. The large log was allowed to sit in the freezer for an hour and then cut into smaller disks.  </p>

                <h3> Red Velvet Whoopie Pies </h3>
                <p> A strange and wonderful baked good that can be described as a mix between a cookie, cake, and pie - it is a combination of two small cakes with filling in between. For this version I chose to make red velvet cake with vanilla buttercream as the filling.  </p>

                <h3> Apple Roses </h3>
                <p> Roses made from freshly picked New England Apples from an expedition to Honey Pot Hill Farms in MA. The apples were cut and cooked in water in the microwave for 5 minutes so they would be tender enough to bend. The apples were then lined in a row along strips of puff pastry and dusted with cinnamon and vanilla. Finally the puff pastry was rolled up and inserted in a muffin pan and baked until golden brown. </p>
