		<h3>Fruit Tart</h3>
		<p>For this tart, I focused on creating a healthy, yet delicious dessert. It was the first time I had made this recipe so I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out, but it turned out great. I made a typical crust filled with pastry cream, topped with fresh strawberries and blackberries. <a href="http://www.joyofbaking.com/FruitTart.html" target="_blank">Here</a> was the recipe I used. Until next time!! </p>
