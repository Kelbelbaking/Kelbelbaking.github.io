                <h3> Apple Cider Donut Holes </h3>
                <p> Finally adapting to the New England traditions of my school environment I decided to make quintessential apple cider donut holes. The recipe was really easy utilizing apple butter and apple cider to get the classic flavors. After the mini donut holes were baked in a mini muffin pan they were dipped in butter and rolled in cinnamon sugar. </p>
